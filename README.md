wordwrap
========

Problem Description
-------------------

Create a function that takes two parameters: a string, and an integer that
represents maximum line length.  The function should return the string with
linebreaks inserted at the right positions, like a word processor, to ensure
that no line is longer than the maximum line length.

Alternative Solution
--------------------

The Python User Group in Vienna tackled the exact same problem back in March.
Have a look at [their solution over at BitBucket][1].
